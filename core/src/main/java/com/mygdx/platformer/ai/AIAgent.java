/**
 * Abstract base class for all AI agents in the game.
 * <p>
 * This class provides the core functionality for AI-controlled characters,
 * including target tracking, distance calculations, and behavior tree
 * integration.
 * It serves as the foundation for specialized AI implementations such as enemy
 * AI.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AIAgent maintains information about:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The character being controlled</li>
 * <li>Target position and distance</li>
 * <li>Detection and attack ranges</li>
 * <li>Line-of-sight calculations</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementations must provide their own update logic and behavior
 * tree
 * configurations to define specific AI behaviors.
