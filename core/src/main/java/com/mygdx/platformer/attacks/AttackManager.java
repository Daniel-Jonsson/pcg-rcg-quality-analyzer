/**
 * Manages all projectile attacks in the game world.
 * <p>
 * The {@code AttackManager} is responsible for the complete lifecycle of attack
 * objects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Spawning different types of attacks (player and enemy)</li>
 * <li>Updating attack positions and states</li>
 * <li>Rendering active attacks</li>
 * <li>Removing attacks when they hit targets or leave the visible area</li>
 * <li>Scaling attack damage and speed based on difficulty level</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The manager works with the Box2D physics system to create and destroy attack
 * bodies,
 * and integrates with the game's audio system to play appropriate sound effects
 * when
 * attacks are spawned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Attack types are defined in {@link AppConfig.AttackType} and include player
 * throwing daggers,
 * goblin projectiles, and necromancer death bolts, each with their own visual
 * appearance,
 * damage values, and sound effects.
