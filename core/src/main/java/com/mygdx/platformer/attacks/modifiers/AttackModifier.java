 * Interface for defining attack modifier behaviors in the game.

 * lifecycle (e.g., adding
 * effects such as pulsing, splitting, or changing speed).
 * <p>
 * Attack modifiers are used both in runtime gameplay and in code generation for
 * analysis, allowing
 * for flexible and extensible attack logic.
