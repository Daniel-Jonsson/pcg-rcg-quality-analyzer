/**
 * Manages the game's difficulty progression system.
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Singleton and Observer design patterns to provide
 * a centralized difficulty management system. The difficulty level increases
 * automatically over time, and registered observers are notified of these
 * changes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The difficulty progression affects various game elements such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enemy spawn rates and types</li>
 * <li>Attack damage and speed</li>
 * <li>Level complexity</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Game components that need to respond to difficulty changes should implement
 * the {@link GameDifficultyObserver} interface and register with this manager.
