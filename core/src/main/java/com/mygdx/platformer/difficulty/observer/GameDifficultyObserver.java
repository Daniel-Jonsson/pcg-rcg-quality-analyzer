/**
 * Observer interface for game difficulty changes.
 * <p>
 * This interface implements the Observer pattern for game difficulty changes.
 * Classes that need to respond to changes in game difficulty should implement
 * this interface and register themselves with a difficulty subject/publisher.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the game's difficulty level changes, the subject will notify all
 * registered
 * observers by calling their {@code onDifficultyChanged} method with the new
 * difficulty level.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical implementations might include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enemy spawners that adjust spawn rates or enemy types</li>
 * <li>Attack managers that scale damage or projectile speed</li>
 * <li>UI components that display the current difficulty</li>
 * <li>Level generators that modify level complexity</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
