/**
 * A centralized audio management system for the platformer game.
 * <p>
 * This utility class provides a unified interface for handling all audio
 * aspects of the game:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Background music playback and control</li>
 * <li>Sound effect loading, caching, and playback</li>
 * <li>Volume management based on user settings</li>
 * <li>Resource management for audio assets</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class uses LibGDX's audio system and implements a singleton pattern with
 * static methods for easy access throughout the codebase. Sound effects are
 * cached in a map using the SoundType enum as keys to improve performance and
 * reduce memory usage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Initialize sounds at game startup
 * AudioManager.loadSounds();
 * 
 * // Start background music
 * AudioManager.playBackgroundMusic();
 * 
 * // Play a sound effect
 * AudioManager.playSound(SoundType.BUTTONCLICK);
 * 
 * // Clean up resources when done
 * AudioManager.dispose();
 * </pre>
 * </p>
